# About me
Hello, Glad you found this blog. I write about Data,Code and Mathematics. Let's have a conversation. :coffee: or : beers : on Me ! Let's nerd out with data and machine learning systems.

I am an undergrad at Winona State University. You can usually find me talking about data , visualization and programming. Other than that, I play soccer , ping-pong and binge watch TV shows.This blog almosts mirror me but not completely.
